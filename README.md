# NagiosPluginFramework

The NagiosPluginFramework project is to help you write Nagios plugins.  The goal is to simplify handling things like warning, critical, and ok thresholds.  

You can build the gem like this.

git clone https://github.com/gamewizard84/NagiosPluginFramework.git

gem build  NagiosFramework.gemspec

gem install NagiosFramework.gemspec

You can view how to use the framework by looking at load_avg.rb .
